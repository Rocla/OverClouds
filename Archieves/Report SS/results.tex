\subsection{Results \& Technologies Recommendations}
The Spring Project is now finished, and lot of information has been gathered. This chapter will target our recommendations based on the results for the following into the Bachelor Project.

\subsubsection{Communication}
\paragraph{Serverless} The analysis concluded that Overclouds can work without relying on centralized servers. We recommend to look at a WebTorrent\cite{Torrent2015WebTorrent} protocol combination with the serverless protocol already in use. This could fix the question of how users are giving their private address to each other.

\subsubsection{Encryption}
\paragraph{Blake2} Based on the Table ~\ref{tab:fastest-hashes}  and Figure ~\ref{fig:hash-ops-best} we recommend the use of Blake2, however it wasn't tested yet with our data encryption. From the tested cryptography libraries, Stanford Javascript Crypto Library is recommended.
