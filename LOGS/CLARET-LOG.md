# Log for the student: Romain Claret

2016-05-24 -> 2016-05-27 Week 1 / 8
  - PROGRESS:
    - management: 2016-05-24 | 09:00-18:30 => 9.50
      - Restructuring the project for the TB
      - Initial Log + Start-Bachelor-Session tag on git
      - Create and Submit documents to Massimo (his assistant: Laetitia Gauchat)
      - Looking for Scrum Tools (free) in order interesting to less
        - VivifyScrum, targetprocess, Easybacklog, visualstudio, agilefant, Trello, icescrum, agilofortrac
      - Looking for Scrum Tools (not free)
        - JIRA, scrumdo
      - Planning for TB
        - Created backlog/springs on VivifyScrum (8 sprints for the project itself)
        - Created backlog/springs for the report + defense presentation
      - Launched sprint 1
      - Meeting with teacher
      - Teacher has been invited to VivifyScrum
  - TODO
    - Setup NodeJS / npm workspace?
    - Travis-CI (Continous Integration)?
  - NOTES:
    - TB requires 340h, 45h per week, 9h per workday, or 8h per workday + 5h extra
    - Officially during the first two weeks
      - submit the plan after the first two weeks
    - JIRA could be interesting to use because it's popular for companies
      - Otherwise, I would go on VivifyScrum which looks like I imagined a digital Scrum board
    - 1 sprint per week (8 sprints in total for the project itself)
    - 2 extras sprints (report + defense presentation)
    - For Sprint 1, Monday, and Wednesday are at the charge of the school for booking the day for other activities than TB.
    - JIRA doesn't look as good as VivifyScrum. We should pay them 10$/month instead of JIRA for full access.

2016-02-24 | 15:00 1st Meeting
  - 25th May school vs. companies conference
    - The school is taking the hours on their account, should not be punishing for the student (me)
  - 6th June rdv for master
    - We will see about this next meeting
  - Change the specifications?
    - Should read the new specifications for the meeting (sprint 2)
  - Possible to have a JIRA license from school?
    - Yes
  - Feasible to book a room or is there usable space on Neuchatel?
    - I should check with the director
