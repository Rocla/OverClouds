  - NOTES:
    - TB requires 340h, 45h per week, 9h per workday, or 8h per workday + 5h extra
    - Officially during the first two weeks
      - submit the planning after the first two weeks
      - complete the documentation: https://intranet.he-arc.ch/dq/Pages/FOR-REA-ING-BAC.aspx
    - JIRA could be interesting to use because it's popular for companies
      - Otherwise, I would go on VivifyScrum which looks like I imagined a digital Scrum board
