      - trying to install an ethereum node on my beaglebone for a private blockchain and mining
        - beaglebone failed on many levels, too old, and failed at extending the EMMC
        - bought a raspberry pi 4 should arrive in 5-6 days
          - existing images with geth preinstalled
    - research: 2016-05-26 | 10:00-19:30 => 9.5
      - Looking at NodeJS/NPM dev environment, watching video tutorials
        - Looking at Browserify for the client-side solution, but don't look like fitting the need
      - Pouchdb, offline storing right into the browser framework with sync once connected
      - Looking at Backbone.js
      - Looking at AngularJS 1 & 2
      - Looking for concepts: http://www.peer-server.com
      - Looking at ethereum node in browser solutions
        - Ethereum-JS
        - NodeJS (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereum.js/)
        - Parity with RTC (but need to run a client on the user machine)
        - Looking at ethereum.org forums
      - Looking at: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs.github.io
        - https://github.com/ethereumjs/browser-builds
        - https://github.com/ethereumjs/node-blockchain-server
    - research: 2016-05-30 | 10:00-16:00 => 6.00
      - Research on Maidsafe
        - consensus over data existing
        - no developers API for now
        - the development moves slowly?
        - not very popular however there is a lot of hopes from the community itself
        - the network pays the users for participating in the network
      - Research on Ethereum
        - Looking at Docker solutions for mining and custom private net
        - Blockchain can be kept small, only synch the last blocks (useful for mining)
      - Research on existing blockchain/consensus technology done right from the browsers
        - none found
    - research: 2016-05-30 | 12:30-19:00 + 21:00-22:00
      - meeting with the teacher
        - the sprints are now ending on Wednesday
        - review of the current sprints
        - subscribed to a recurring plan on vivifyScrum
          - must document how vivifyScrum is better than a text log (visual is not enough)
        - discussed of the requirements for the report (a lot of annexes if okay)
        - Validated the specifications
      - Research on IDE and Tools for development
        - Wakanda (not for our project)
        - Bundle options for standalone version of nodejs with install (deployment)
        - Learning the basis of NodeJS to be sure that it's what we should go with
        - Looking at Electron
        - Angular would be compatible with a bundled nodejs app
      - As another interesting blockchain for developers Counterparty, based on Bitcoin.
        - A platform for free and open financial tools on the Bitcoin network.
      - Ethereum Mist (official client/wallet) uses a bundled nodejs
      - Testing docker solution for mining (testnet), it works
  - TODO
    - Travis-CI (Continous Integration)?
      - With nodejs and browserfify also?
    - Which languages to use on ethereum contracts?
      - Serpent? etc?
    - Should deploy on Private blockchain or Test/Mainnet?

  - NOTES:
    - TB requires 340h, 45h per week, 9h per workday, or 8h per workday + 5h extra
    - Officially during the first two weeks
      - submit the plan after the first two weeks
    - JIRA could be interesting to use because it's popular for companies
      - Otherwise, I would go on VivifyScrum which looks like I imagined a digital Scrum board
    - 1 sprint per week (8 sprints in total for the project itself)
    - 2 extras sprints (report + defense presentation)
    - For Sprint 1, Monday, and Wednesday are at the charge of the school for booking the day for other activities than TB.
    - JIRA doesn't look as good as VivifyScrum. We should pay them 10$/month instead of JIRA for full access.
    - Pouchdb stores offline in the browser and sync data once connected to server https://pouchdb.com
    - Backbone and Angularjs are interesting, but it needs a server to work...

  - 25th May school vs. companies conference
    - The school is taking the hours on their account, should not be punishing for the student (me)

    - Should read the new specifications for the meeting (sprint 2)
