  - NOTES:
    - TB requires 340h, 45h per week, 9h per workday, or 8h per workday + 5h extra

      - submit the plan after the first two weeks
      - complete the documentation: https://intranet.he-arc.ch/dq/Pages/FOR-REA-ING-BAC.aspx
    - JIRA could be interesting to use because it's popular for companies
      - Otherwise, I would go on VivifyScrum which looks like I imagined a digital Scrum board

    - 2 extras sprints (report + defense presentation)
