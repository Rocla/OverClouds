# Log for the teacher: Marc Schaefer

2016-02-10 pre-meeting with student
  - read the specifications (CDC) + eventually suggest additions
  - first rough iteration draft (product backlog?)

2016-02-17 normal meeting with student
  - goals
    - CDC finalization: OK
    - run through first rough iteration draft: OK

  - wiki: nothing (not a problem)
  - GIT
    - SCRUM.md: most of the objectives are there

  - missing first draft of iterations (what will be done in the 10 weeks of the project), developed first draft:
    - SPRINT1 (state+planif+draft architecture)   2 weeks
    - SPRINT2  communication
    - SPRINT3  encryption
    - SPRINT4  trust
    - SPRINT5  storage
    - SPRINTN (finalizing rapport)

    result at each sprint:
      - deliverables (small prototype, demo, library)
        - what is missing (to do during bachelor session, to do at the next sprint, drop): eventually manage as a list of backlogS.

    next week goal
      - list of iterations (=? sprint)
      - expected duration
      - deliverables attendus
      - // start of sprint 1

2016-02-24 normal meeting with student

   -  architecture draft
     - how do all the nodes get the list of all the nodes? is that required? (alternative: peer nodes flooding)

   - journal: OK
   - list of iterations: OK (SCRUM-SPRINTS-SS.md)
        sprint 2: deliverable: demo in the browser using communication
        sprint 3: deliverable: demo in the browser using encryption
        sprint 4-5: deliverables missing
        sprint 6: number is 6 or 7;  maybe start the report a few weeks ahead and run this sprint parallel
   - technical
        - no spaces in file names
   - iteration 1
        think about
           - notions of access rights
           - describe how the data is encrypted
           - show how to implement the base functions either:
             - create a data set, delete, eventually update
             - give the right to read, eventually delete; ban of data/users
           - Considering the architecture as plugin-ins, what could we imagine to not implement but encapsulate in existing? (== isolate the support services that you need)
   - iteration 2:
        - *direct* communication client-client
        - is tor eventually utilizable if the time is short?

   - Massimo contract
