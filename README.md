## In brief

Overclouds is a project whose goal is to create a new generation of an anonymous and decentralized internet data sharing service. The time of requiring an entry-point or centralized service directory servers in order to connect to a network is over. All you need is a browser with javascript capabilities and run an HTML file from either your local machine or online via a server.


## Short project description

We will conceptualize and create/prototype a decentralized and anonymous network accessible from a browser.
The features include:

- No servers or directories as an intermediary for the connection to another node.
- Storage directly on the network via the nodes (distributed storage)
- Share data between nodes


## Long Project Description

The initiative behind the project is to create a new generation of internet data sharing tools, suited for today's paranoia for privacy on the internet and the preservation of knowledge for the next humanity generations.
People and things don't need anymore to be connected to directories, servers, or farms of servers anymore. Everybody and everything are now anonymous nodes, and they connect one to another freely.
The network is a mesh of nodes. The data is moving from a node to another across the network via other nodes.
All that users or things need is to have a standard Internet connection and a browser with javascript capabilities. Then either launch a local HTML file or enter the URL of a server which is hosting this file.


## Features

- No server
- Anonymous nodes
- Data encryption
- Public data
- Storage "on network"
- Webapps

### Software
- Any Browser with Webworkers and WebRTC built-in

### Hardware
- Any "computer"
