\subsection{Storage}
As theme's sprint got moved to the Bachelor Backlog, the researched as not been made. However, parallel research and concept evolution as led into a superficial analysis.

\paragraph{Verbs} Only Read, Write and Destroy makes current sense in our latest architecture. Indeed, Edit has an only sense if data versioning is integrated, which has not yet researched. We would have to work with the data address to keep a consistency and a low network load for Readers.

\paragraph{Flags} Used to filters, and to ban, they must be persistent in the file, identity, and nodes.

\paragraph{Global knowledge} Block-chains technology could be interesting for this purpose, however, we concluded that it is not the only possibility. Indeed, technologies such as VCS can be compatible also like directories (free track of a list of nodes, activities, etc.) or versioning (pull requests, etc.).
