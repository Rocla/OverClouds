The initiative behind the project is to create a new generation of internet data sharing tools, suited for today's paranoia for privacy on the internet and the preservation of knowledge for the next humanity generations.

The idea is to give the ability to the user to not rely on corporate servers, or farms of servers anymore. On Over Clouds, everybody and everything are now anonymous nodes, and they connect one to another freely and anonymously.

The network is a democratic mesh of nodes. The data is moving from a node to another across the network via other nodes and is ruled by the consensus of users.

We are aiming that users only need to have a standard Internet connection and a browser with JavaScript capabilities to use the service.
