\subsection{Cryptography}
Sadly not much has been down for the implementation of this part. We have however made and tested an encryption app in the browser with the \textbf{Creating a File Encryption App with JavaScript} tutorial\cite{Angelov2013CreatingJavaScript} by Martin Angelov.

We, of course, used the CryptoJS library\cite{Brix2013CryptoJS}, which is part of the tutorial. However, we also tested to replace this it with SJCL\cite{Stark2009SymmetricJavascript}, it worked, but didn't investigate further for the gain is speed and security. However, if we rely on the Table ~\ref{tab:key-derivation-pbkdf2} in the Analysis Chapter on Cryptography, we should be able to see significant differences.
