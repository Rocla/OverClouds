\subsection{Management}
An iterative approach has been used during the progress of the project. So, the SCRUM methodology was chosen. You can find the Backlog and the Sprint progress in the annexes.

Originally 6 sprints were planned. However the progress of the project was going as fast as intended. Finally, we ended up with four sprints and 2 replannings.

Indeed, an error was made by the student during the initial planning, he planned the scrums based on results and not man-hours (86h) which was in fact about 8.6h per week during 10 weeks. However the required work per week to produce the scrum results was largely above. We noticed at week 3 that something wasn't right, resulting into forcing to control that the 8.6 hours were not exceeded. We noticed that 43 hours were made instead of 34.4, and decide on week 5 to do a new planning with 1 weeks increase on the current sprint.

The planning was remade for the second time on week 6, 46 hours was produced at that time for 43 required. The number of scrum schedule got reduced into 4 sprints, and by this means moving 2 research themes into the bachelor backlog.

At the end of the 10th week, the student spent 111h + XX, note that on week 8, 81h hours was made.

It's important to note that the problems didn't only come from the unrealistic first planning, expect if the research was done very lightly, but the prototype would have not been something to relay on. The student was a bit to much interested about the new world is was discovering and started to do maybe to deep research into each treated subjects, times flew much faster than expected, and time was missing in the end for the planning.

The last 2 weeks got very expensive in time in the goal to deliver the report with the research done, even planned research.

For the Bachelor planning, the man-hours will be more carefully looked at, and adjust the planning right away if something isn't going has planned.
