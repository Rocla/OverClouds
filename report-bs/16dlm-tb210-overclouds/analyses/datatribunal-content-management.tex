\subsubsection{Data tribunal}

\subsubsection{Data Sharing} The content is distributed differently depending on user's willing to use an identity or not. In the case of anonymity, the shared data is only active as long as the user is connected to the network or that an identity decide to add it to its account. For identities, they have the choice to save it to their account, and by this mean retrieve the data during another session. More can be found in the Content Managment
