# Spring Project (TP): Overclouds
- No Projet: 16DLM-TB210
- Auteur: Claret Romain
- Professeur: Schaefer Marc
- Language: HTML5 & Javascript
- Abstract: Overclouds is a project whose goal is to create an anonymous and decentralized internet data sharing service right through the browser.

# Description
## Fran√ßais

## English
The initiative behind the project is to create a new generation of internet data sharing tools, suited for today's paranoia for privacy on the internet and the preservation of knowledge for the next humanity generations.
The idea is to give the ability to the user to not rely on corporate servers, or farms of servers anymore. On Over Clouds, everybody and everything are now anonymous nodes, and they connect one to another freely and anonymously.
The network is a democratic mesh of nodes. The data is moving from a node to another across the network via other nodes and is ruled by the consensus of users.
We are aiming that users only need to have a standard Internet connection and a browser with javascript capabilities to use the service.

# Preface
## Introduction
## The big picture
### Concept
- Anyone can be part of the community right from the browser and no additional software installation.
- Each user is identified by a virtual identity and has access to its personal virtual "desktop" right from the browser.
- The machines used to join the network have also their own certificate, which provides their uniqueness.
- The trust and the consensus on the network is a combination of the identities and the hardware certificates.

### The consensus
- Each user of the network is part of the consensus, a democratic community.
- Overclouds' is directed by rules/laws made and voted by the consensus.
- Private keys from the users are owned and stored by the consensus, which allows a control of the data.
- It follows ownership and transactions of the data.

### The Network
- The network is joined automatically once the user launches the web page (locally or on a server).
- The user is being connected to a random node (from a list of trusted nodes maintained and signed by the consensus on services such as Github, Twitter, IRC, etc...) which will act has a gateway to the network.
- Once connected, a secure tunnel is created to Overclouds' consensus.
- Nodes are anonymised by the consensus, however, a democratic vote can reveal a node.
- An existing anonymous network could be used to connect to the consensus such as TOR.
- Overcloud verifies the transactions on the network by applying the rules from the consensus.

### Nodes
- They are the computational power of the network.
- Nodes can work without an identity attached to it. However, the web page should be running in a browser to work.
- It can act as a gateway, a relay, a computational source, and a storage.
- It owns a certificate that identifies it on the network. A level of trust is given to it, and can be reset.

### Mesh-of-Trust
- The consensus uses a combination of nodes' certificates and identities using them.
- While using (being active on) the network, the level of trust is increasing.
- The network manages a data tribunal, where the blamed data are automatically banned, but those data owners can require a trial to retrieve those data.
- During a trial, the network select trusted users to vote on the status of the data (must or must not be banned).
- By default, the consensus is automatic distributing the trust along users.
- Users are able to give a manual trust level to specific nodes and/or identities. This allows a customization for the data transfer or storage.

### Storage
- The data belongs to an identity, however, an identity is anonymous except is the consensus decides otherwise.
- As long as the identity is anonymous, the data can be managed by the owner as it is pleased.
- The user can give the rights of read, write, delete, or administration to other identities. (form of sharing)

## Objectives
### About
The goal for the Spring Project is to prepare the Bachelor Project by making and/or planning iterations by performing research (already done) and/or prototyping (proof-of-concept) various aspects of the project.

### Deliverables
The requirements are:
- Simple prototypes validating the assumptions for each iteration (sprint)
- Report of the TP (current project) with the comparisons and justification of choice made for each sprint. As well as the architecture of the system.
- The specification of the TB (bachelor project, see chapter X)
- Detailed planning of the TB (see chapter X)

## Specifications
