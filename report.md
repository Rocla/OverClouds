# Spring Project (TP): Overclouds
- No Projet: 16DLM-TB210
- Auteur: Claret Romain
- Professeur: Schaefer Marc
- Language: HTML5 & Javascript
- Abstract: Overclouds is a project whose goal is to create an anonymous and decentralized internet data sharing service right through the browser.

# Description
## Fran√ßais

## English
The initiative behind the project is to create a new generation of internet data sharing tools, suited for today's paranoia for privacy on the internet and the preservation of knowledge for the next humanity generations.
The idea is to give the ability to the user to not rely on corporate servers, or farms of servers anymore. On Over Clouds, everybody and everything are now anonymous nodes, and they connect one to another freely and anonymously.
The network is a democratic mesh of nodes. The data is moving from a node to another across the network via other nodes and is ruled by the consensus of users.
We are aiming that users only need to have a standard Internet connection and a browser with javascript capabilities to use the service.

# Preface
## Introduction
## The big picture
### Concept
- Anyone can be part of the community right from the browser and no additional software installation.
- Each user is identified by a virtual identity, and has access to its personal virtual "desktop" right from the browser.
- The machines used to join the network have also their own certificate, which provide their uniqueness.
- The trust and the consensus on the network is a combinason of the identities and the hardware certificates.

### The consensus
- Each user of the network is part of the concensus, a democratic community.
- Overclouds' is directed by rules/laws made and voted by the concensus.

### The Network
- The network is joined automatically once the user launch the webpage (locally or on a server).
- The user is being connected to a random node (from a list of trusted nodes maintained and signed by the concensus on services such as github, twitter, irc, etc...) which will act has a gateway to the network.
- Once connected, a secure tunnel is created to Overclouds' concensus.
- Nodes are anonymised by the concensus, however a democratic vote can reveal a node.
- An existing anonymous network could be used to connect to the concensus such as TOR.
- Overcloud verifies the transactions on the network by applying the rules from the concensus.

### Nodes
- They are the computational power of the network.
- Nodes can work without an identity attached to it. However the webpage should be running in a browser to work.
- It can act as a gateway, a rely, a computational source, and a storage.
- It owns a certificatate that identifies it on the network. A level of trust is given to it, and can be reseted.

## Objectives
### About
The goal for the Spring Project is to prepare the Bachelor Project by making and/or planning iterations by performing research (already done) and/or prototyping (proof-of-concept) various aspects of the project.

### Deliverables
The requirements are:
- Simple prototypes validating the assumptions for each iteration (sprint)
- Report of the TP (current project) with the comparisons and justification of choice made for each sprint. As well as the architecture of the system.
- The specification of the TB (bachelor project)
- Detailed planning of the TB
